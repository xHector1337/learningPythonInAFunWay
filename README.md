This is a project to help children to write their very first python lines in an interactive way.

## Installation and Usage

After cloning or downloading the repository you can basically run it by either typing `python game.py` to command line or executing the file with python.
Note: Make sure that your current working directory is same with the directory you have `game.py` and `save.json`.

Happy coding.
